# Healers Project: Interview Collection DMP
collection description text

## Roles & Responsibilities
**The DMP should clearly articulate how sharing of primary data is to be implemented.  It should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur if a project director or co-project director leaves the institution or project. Any costs stemming from the management of data should be explained in the budget notes.**

The Healers interview collection consists of audio clips of interviews, as well as accompanying transcripts and translations, conducted through years of fieldwork throughout the Caribbean and the Pacific Northwest. These interviews broadly address the question: What does healing look like in the context of Afro-indigenous traditions? The interview collection will be shared with the general public using the University of Oregon’s cultural heritage digital library, Oregon Digital. It will also be deposited into the Digital Library of the Caribbean at the University of Florida. We are taking a multi-institutional approach to having the collection in both digital repositories because we believe in LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe). However, the authoritative interviews will be held by the University of Oregon and aggregated through the Digital Library of the Caribbean not the University of Oregon.

- **Alai Reyes Santos**, *Healers Project Principal Investigators*, is the director and producer of the interview collection. She is responsible for interview collection development and complying with data management guidelines set by the Healers Project data managers. Interviews that are captured by Alai give her the authority to determine what is and is not included in the interview collection through the UO Libraries and the Digital Library of the Caribbean. It is important to note that all interviews in this collection are clips, not full interviews. This is because full explanation of the Healer’s customs and practices are restricted only to their communities. Alai is responsible for ensuring whatever interview clips become public have been approved for public sharing before archiving with UO and dLOC.

- **Rachael Lee**, Digital Humanities Research Assistant GE, is a Healers Project data manager. She is responsible for tracking and communicating with other Healer's data managers about all incoming interviews and organizing them within a content inventory before the interviews are treated for archival access and preservation. Rachael time on the project is grant funded and limited to its duration. Her responsibilities will be passed on to a new GE or Kate Thornhill.

- **Elizabeth Peterson**, UO Libraries, is a Healers Project data manager. She is responsible for managing the interview collections metadata, troubleshooting and setting up streaming media platforms, converting interview file formats, and aiding with other data curation activities.

- **Kate Thornhill**, UO Libraries, oversees all data management work for the Healers Project and the data management team. If any data managers leave the project, then she is responsible for their contributions and work on the interview project. She supports GEs and interns brought onto the project through data manager team training, understanding requirements and specifications for data to be formatted and interoperable for platform upload and access. She is also the administrative contact for any transcription and translation needs required through vendor services.

## Expected Data
**The DMP should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, or other materials to be produced during the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.
Project directors should address matters such as these in the DMP:**
- **the types of data that their project might generate and eventually share with others, and under what conditions;**
- **how data will be managed and maintained until shared with others;**
- **factors that might impinge on their ability to manage data, for example, legal and ethical restrictions on access to non-aggregated data;**
- **the lowest level of aggregated data that project directors might share with others in the scholarly or scientific community, given that community's norms on data;**
- **the mechanism for sharing data and/or making it accessible to others; and**
- **other types of information that should be maintained and shared regarding data, for example, the way it was generated, analytical and procedural information, and the metadata.**


### Data types
There will be a minimum of 20 interviews in this digital collection. The interviews that will be published on the web include audio (.mp3) and transcription and translation documents (.pdfs). 

*Data quantity:* As of spring 2023, there are 20 interviews. These interviews are clips from longer ones. It is important to note that the collection will grow as more interviews are added. This means for every interview in the collection, data managers need also count the transcription and translation. So, if there are 20 interview clips then there are 20 transcriptions and 20 translations, which makes the collection contact 60 files. 
Here is a breakdown of collection size, work type, file format, total number of assets, average file size, and average total size for a set of file types.
